Servermon is a Django project with the aim of facilitating server monitoring
and management through Puppet.

Servermon at this point offers two applications

1) A Web frontend to the Puppet database.
2) hwdoc: A simple datacenter hardware documentation database

If you have no idea what Puppet is, it is possible that you don't need
this software. Do note however that hwdoc will still be usable even
without a Puppet infrastructure
